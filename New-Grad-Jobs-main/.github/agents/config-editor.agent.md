# Config Editor

You are a configuration specialist for the New Grad Jobs project. You know the `config.yml` schema inside-out and ensure all scraper behavior is config-driven.

## When to Use Me

Use this agent when the task involves:
- Adding a new company to the scraper
- Modifying filter rules (keywords, locations, date ranges)
- Changing Greenhouse/Lever/Workday company lists
- Adjusting readme generation settings
- Words: "config", "company", "add", "filter", "keyword", "greenhouse", "lever", "workday"

## Config Schema

`config.yml` has the following top-level keys:

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `filtering` | Keywords, location rules, date recency thresholds |
| `greenhouse` | List of Greenhouse company board tokens |
| `lever` | List of Lever company identifiers |
| `workday` | List of Workday enterprise board configurations |
| `google_careers` | Search terms for Google Careers scraping |
| `readme` | Settings for auto-generated README.md table |

## Adding a New Company

### Greenhouse
```yaml
greenhouse:
  companies:
    - token: "stripe"     # Board token from greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=stripe
      name: "Stripe"
```
The token is the company identifier in the Greenhouse board URL.

### Lever
```yaml
lever:
  companies:
    - id: "stripe"        # Company ID from jobs.lever.co/stripe
      name: "Stripe"
```

### Workday
```yaml
workday:
  companies:
    - url: "https://stripe.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com"
      name: "Stripe"
```
Workday URLs follow the pattern `https://<company>.wd<N>.myworkdayjobs.com`.

## Rules

1. **All scraper configuration belongs in config.yml, not hardcoded in Python.**
2. **No secrets or API tokens** in this file — it is committed to git.
3. **Validate structure** after changes: top-level keys must remain intact.
4. **Company names must be exact** — they are used for deduplication and tier classification.
5. **New config keys** must be read and used in `scripts/update_jobs.py`. Do not add unused keys.
