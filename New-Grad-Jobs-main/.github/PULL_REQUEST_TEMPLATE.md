  PR TITLE — READ BEFORE TYPING (bot will auto-reject if wrong)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Format:  <type>(<scope>): <short summary, lowercase, no period>

  Types:
    feat     – new feature or company added
    fix      – bug fix
    docs     – documentation only
    test     – tests only, no production code
    chore    – maintenance (deps, CI, housekeeping)
    refactor – code change that is neither fix nor feature
    perf     – performance improvement

  Scopes (optional but recommended):
    scraper, config, filter, dedup, ci, docs, tests, frontend

  ✅ feat(config): add Stripe to Greenhouse companies
  ✅ fix(scraper): handle None date in normalize_date_string
  ✅ fix(filter): handle Unicode characters in company names
  ✅ test(dedup): add edge case for get_job_key with math.nan
  ✅ chore(ci): pin trivy-action to v0.28.0
  ✅ docs(contributing): clarify assignment workflow

  ❌ Update config          ← no type, no description
  ❌ Fixed the bug          ← no type, too vague
  ❌ feat: Added companies  ← capital letter, past tense

  Shortcut: title the PR "@coderabbitai" and the bot renames it correctly.
